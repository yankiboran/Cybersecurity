Let's take a look at launching an EC2 Instance with the UserScript functionality to build a CTF Challenge. UserScripts helps us to initialize the EC2 Instance with pre-defined configurations. 

**UserScript defined below:**
- Installs necessary packages.
- Creates hidden files or services containing flags.
- Sets up environment configurations for challenges.

**Understanding User Data Scripts**
When you launch an EC2 instance, you can pass a script via the User Data field. This script runs with root privileges during the first boot cycle of the instance.

*Format:* The script can be written in bash, PowerShell, or any other scripting language supported by the instance's OS.
*Encoding:* Ensure the script is in plain text. For Windows instances, scripts should be Base64-encoded.
